    <p>Developing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects have become more common.
        ML and DL are literary everywhere nowadays, from big corporations to schools and universities, 
        and used in areas from medicine to robotics. But with the extensive use and variability of the 
        projects where ML/DL is used, some problems need to tackle. When working on and developing such 
        projects, the most common issue is the conflict between different libraries. This problem can 
        easily be solved if we use virtual environments.</p>

    <p>A virtual environment is precisely what the word describes, an environment, a sandbox, where we 
        install libraries and software particular to the project we're working on. In data science, ML and DL, 
        the Anaconda environments are the most well-known platforms used to create and manage virtual environments.</p>

    <p>Anaconda environments offer a simple and elegant solution to manage our settings based on the project requirements we're working on. 
        I think the power of anaconda environments comes from using a different version of python from a single installation. 
        Also, we can easily use other anaconda repositories to install the GPU versions of ML/DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch with ease.</p>

    <h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

    <p>The miniconda, a minimal version of Anaconda, will be installed here. Download the latest miniconda 
        Linux installer script at https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh. 
        Also, at <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Miniconda ‚Äî Conda documentation</a>, 
        different miniconda installers and for other platforms (Windows, MacOSX, Linux).</p>

    <p>Once the installer is downloaded, open a terminal and navigate to the location the script has been downloaded. 
        For me is in <code>/home/myusername/Downloads</code> First, check and verify the integrity of the installer</p>

    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>sha256sum Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</span></code></pre></div>
    <p>and will get something similar to <code>4ee9c3aa53329cd7a63b49877c0babb49b19b7e5af29807b793a76bdb1d362b4</code> 
        this value needs to compare it with the one given on the miniconda site. If the values much mean the download is 
        not corrupted and can continue with the installation.</p>

    <p>Then need to make the script executable (if it is not already) using the <code>chmod</code> command and then run the installer itself with the 
        <code>./program-to-install</code> This can be done by running the following command</p>

    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">chmod</span> +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</span></code></pre></div>
    <p>The installation procedure is pretty clear after that point. Need to scroll down to the end of EULA terms and conditions and type 
        <code>yes</code> to agree with them.</p>

    <p>Also, it is a good idea to agree with the default installation path, which is usually under the path 
        <code>/home/myusername/miniconda3</code>. The installation directory can also be specified to a different location, 
        but you need to add it to the path variable on your system to run miniconda.</p>

    <p>The following prompt is essential and will ask to initialize miniconda after the installation and need to type <code>yes</code>. 
        If following the default, <code>no</code> will need to initiaize miniconda manually. To do so need to manually initialize 
        the shell you are using. For example, my shell is <code>zsh</code>, so the command will be <code>conda init zsh</code> 
        and then need to restart your shell with</p>

    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">source</span> ~/.zshrc</span></code></pre></div>
    <p>Now, the last step is not necessary, but Anaconda activates the base environment whenever you open your terminal by default, 
        and I found that a bit annoying. So to remove the default functionality need to execute the following</p>
