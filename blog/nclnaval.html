<h2>Why I chose to study MSc Naval Architecture at Newcastle</h2>
            <h3>Course Content</h3>
            <p>I chose to study MSc in Naval Architecture at Newcastle University because I was particularly interested in the course's core modules.
                Having worked on ships as a seagoing engineer for more than ten years, I was keen on learning more about the principles that play a vital 
                role in the ship's operation. In addition, from my earlier studies, I was really enthusiastic about Fluid dynamics, particularly with ship 
                hydrodynamics, about the enormous ship structures and their performance at sea, and the operation and the logistics required to operate 
                and move ships across the world.
            </p>
            <p>          
                The course offers a straightforward though a challenging combination of all the above, some of the course's core modules are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Advanced Hydrodynamics</li>
                    <li>Advanced Marine Structures</li>
                    <li>Advanced Naval Architecture</li>
                    <li>Ship Performance at Sea</li>
                </ul>
            </p>


            <h3>Ranking and Reputation</h3>
                <p>The marine sector plays an essential role in the global economy and trade, but the field itself can be described as a close environment; and when it comes to reputation, it is essential to choose wisely where will you go to study. There are only a handful of choices in the UK or globally when it comes to Marine Technology studies.
                Newcastle University stands out because of its rich and long history and tradition in both Marine Engineering and Naval Architecture, and its reputation is well known among shipping companies.
                Marine Technology at Newcastle is also double accredited by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA) and the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology (IMarEST), which opens more opportunities!</p>

            <h3>Facilities and Academics</h3>
                <p>Let's start with the people who constitute the department. The academic staff are excellent, and with great knowledge, they are ready to help whenever needed.
                They are actively involved in lecturing, in research and with the industry. I found this extraordinary because there is the potential to expand our contacts from academia to industry. But the most important is that I feel like being a part of a larger family!
                Now regarding the facilities, Newcastle University is one of the most well-equipped universities, with the most important being the newly reconstructed Emmerson Cavitation tunnel in Blyth, the school's research vessel (The Princess Royal) and last but not least, the Towing tank and the Wind, Wave and Current tank (WWCT) in the campus.</p>
            <h3>The campus and the city</h3>
                <p>Newcastle upon Tyne!!! The name speaks by itself. By far one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
                Having sailed around the globe as a seafarer, I have visited many cities; some are huge and ugly, others are beautiful with rude people, others are cold and not interesting, but no city can be compared with Newcastle.
                The city of Newcastle has a pleasing balance between a large and small city and offers a range of exquisite places such as the quayside and the Jesmond Dene.
                It has a mixture of warm and welcoming local people (the Geordies) and people from all around the world, making the city one the most attractive.
                The campus itself is a remarkable place in the city's heart, with the most notable buildings being the Armstrong building (where the Marine department is located) and the Old Library.</p>
