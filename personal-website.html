                    During the last year, I'm doing my PhD in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, aka AUVs, and I have dive into programming since 
                    the project is a combination of Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV). Despite how frustrating is sometimes, 
                    actually a lot lot of times, to try to understand the concepts behind ML and CV, I felled in love with programming, 
                    and with Python more specifically. I like how dynamically the language is, and how easily and fast allows for building 
                    and develop prototypes and models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tinkering, and learning the language all this time drove me to do something that I have never done before, to build my own website. 
                    So, I started with the basics, and since I'm a PhD student, the first steps involved a lot of research. I decided to do the website in Python, 
                    but how exactly? I found that there are a few web frameworks that Python can use, such as Flask and Django. I don't know, but I chose Django 
                    because I liked the name.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    The next step was to dive into Django's documentation and see how can I deploy the portfolio website without being a nightmare. 
                    It was unexpected straightforward, from how to start a Django project and app or apps depending on the project, of course, to connect 
                    the HTML pages of the project. I learned how to use Bootstrap to style the site (quite a funny process but with tones of customisation, 
                    and use of CSS).
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Finally, after almost a week of developing the site, the big moment to go alive came. I found in one article about Heroku, and I was ready to 
                    deploy the project there, but accidentally I also found that GitHub allows web hosting through GitHub pages, and it's free. So, after a bit of 
                    thought, I conclude to use GitHub as this was my first web site and need to see how can I dot it better and more dynamic to fulfil my needs and 
                    since I'm still learning Github was the best, and free, option.
