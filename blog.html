									<h1>Virtual environments</h1>
									<p>Developing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects has become more common than ever before. 
                                        ML and DL is literary everywhere nowdays, from big corporations to schools and universities, and used in 
                                        areas from medicine to robotics. But with the extensive use and variability of the projects where ML/DL is 
                                        used, there are problems need to tackle with. The most common issue arises when working and developing such 
                                        projects is the conflict between different libraries. This problem can easily be solved if we use virtual environments.</p>
                                    <p>A virtual environment is exactly what the word describes, an environment, a sandbox, where we install libraries 
                                        and software particular to the project we’re working on. In the world of data science, ML and DL, the most well 
                                        known platform used to create and manage virtual environments is the Anaconda environments.</p>
                                    <p>Anaconda environments offering a simple and elegant solution to mange our environments based on the requirements 
                                        of the project we’re working on. I think the power of anaconda environments comes from the fact that we can use 
                                        different version of python from a single installation. Also, we can easily use different anaconda repositories 
                                        to install the GPU versions of ML/DL frameworks such as TensoFlow and PyTorch with ease.</p>

								<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
                                <p>Here, the miniconda a minimal version of Anaconda will be install. Download the latest miniconda Linux installer script at 
                                    https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh. 
                                    Also, at <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Miniconda — Conda documentation</a> 
                                    different miniconda installers and for different platforms (Windows, MacOSX, Linux).</p>
                                <p>Once the installer downloaded, open a terminal and navigate the the location the script has been download. For me is in <code>/home/myusername/Downloads</code> First, check and verify the integrity of the installer</p>
                                <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>sha256sum Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</span></code></pre></div>
                                <p>and will get something similar to <code>4ee9c3aa53329cd7a63b49877c0babb49b19b7e5af29807b793a76bdb1d362b4</code> this value need to compare it with the one given on the miniconda site. If the values much means the download is not corrupted and can continue with the installation.</p>
                                <p>Then need to change make the script executable (if it is not already) using the <code>chmod</code> command and then run the installer itself with the <code>./program-to-install</code> This can be done by running the following command</p>
                                <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">chmod</span> +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</span></code></pre></div>
                                <p>The installation procedure is pretty clear after that point. Need to scroll down to the end of EULA terms and conditions and type <code>yes</code> to agree with them.</p>
                                <p>Also it is a good idea to agree with the default installation path witch is normally under the path <code>/home/myusername/miniconda3</code>. The installation directory can also be specified to a different location but need to add it to the path variable on your system to run miniconda.</p>
                                <p>The next prompt is important and will ask to initialize miniconda after the installation and need to type <code>yes</code>. If following the default <code>no</code> will need to initialize miniconda manually. To do so need to manually initialize for the shell you are using. For example my shell is <code>zsh</code> so the command will be <code>conda init zsh</code> and then need to restart your shell with</p>
                                <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">source</span> ~/.zshrc</span></code></pre></div>
                                <p>Now, the last step is not something that need to do, but anaconda activates the base environment whenever you open you terminal by default, and I found that a bit of annoying. So to remove the default functionality need to execute the following</p>
                                <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode zsh"><code class="sourceCode zsh"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>conda config --set auto_activate_base <span class="kw">false</span></span></code></pre></div>

									<h2>Cat-vs-Dog <br />
										image classifier</h2>
									<p>I worked on this project to improve my skills on web development and extend my programming knowlwdge. <br/>I used Python
										and Django for my site. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cnn.png" alt="" /><a id="cat-dog"></a></div>
								<p>My first hands-on project on deep learning was the cats and dogs image classification using Kaggle's dataset. 
									Everything started almost a year ago when I started my PhD in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles at Newcastle University.  
									The concept of the project is to create an autonomous vehicle capable not only to detect underwater objects 
									(mainly the underwater infrastructure) but also to be able to examine in depth the integrity of such structures. 
									Hence to give the appropriate solutions and take actions to mitigate any given detected faults. 
									Such a project requires to master and understand in-depth mathematical and statistical concepts. </p>
								<p>Fortunately, I had to spend only a small amount of my time remembering linear algebra and statistics since 
									I had been taught all these in my previous academic years. So, I focused on the most basic concepts of machine learning, 
									such as clustering, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression etc. But, all these were to abstract and 
									general to me, so I started to look at what could possibly do to learn all these concepts by doing instead of just reading. </p>
								<p>At the same time, I joined the university's machine learning course offered by the CS school, and the first assignment was to use Kaggle's Titanic dataset 
									to predict which passengers would survive. Upon completing the assignment, I was so fascinated to continue with machine learning, and I decided to start 
									another project more relevant to my area, and thus I started the cats-and-dogs image classification. 
									During my journey to image classification, I learned a fair amount of the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, how to preprocess the data, and how to split 
									them into training, validation and test datasets.</p>
								<p>Also,  I learn to use deferent techniques (such as data augmentation and feature extraction using pre-trained models) on the data in order to get better and more accurate results. 
									I even wrote scripts which performs bulk rename on the photos and splits the data into training, validation and test datasets. 
									Finally, I experiment a lot using virtual environments for the project and work the image classification on both pure python scripts as well as using jupyter notebooks. </p>

									<h1>Ship Hull Optimization<a id="cfd"></a><br />
										by using Bulbous Stern </h1>
									<p>I worked on this project as part pf my MSc thesis </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cfd.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The present study addresses the effectiveness of a bulbous stern in a container ship by estimating the resistance using semi-empirical and numerical methods (CFD).  The estimation of the resistance is a critical aspect of a ship which affects the power needed to propel the ship, hence the fuel consumption and the gas emissions to the environment. Container vessels are in continuous operation moving commodities of one place of the earth to the other. Therefore, it is vital to be able to operate with the least possible resistance in order to minimise fuel consumption and their carbon footprint. 
								</p>
								<p>For this reason, the hull should be as efficient as possible and can be achieved by applying different techniques to improve the resistance, one of which is the bulbous stern technic. A stern bulb has its basis on the effects of the bulbous bow, which creates an additional wave that that counteracts the wave that is created by the bow with a result a reduced drag. Similarly, a stern bulb attached on the ship’s transom redistributes the wave pattern at the transom area which leads to minimising the wave-making resistance.</p>
								<p>
									In this thesis, the concept of the Stern Bulb has been proposed for reducing the wave-making resistance. The particular area has not been extensively studied, and there are not extensive data to evaluate its effectiveness, especially using CFD simulations in a personal computer which by itself is a challenging task, thus different methods needed to be used such as the Holtrop’s method and Michell’s thin ship theory to validate the CFD results. The chosen container vessel was modelled in dedicated Naval Architecture software using parametric transformation, and a parent hull was obtained, which was the basis of the resistance estimation using bothe the semi-empirical methods and CFD. The next step involved the design of different models of bulbs in CAD software and the preparation of the geometry of the ship models for importing into CFD software for meshing and simulation.  

								</p>
								<p>
									All models, the parent hull, together with the hulls with the different bulb shapes, were tested initially by the semi-empirical methods of resistance estimation, using Holtrop’s method as well as the estimation of the resistance using the analytical method based on Michell’s thin ship theory. From the results observed that Holtrop’s method is more an ideal estimation of the resistance and used to verify the CFD results because Holtrop’s method is incapable of modelling the stern bulb. On the other hand, Michell’s thin ship theory takes into account the wave resistance, which captures the behaviour of the bulbous stern more realistically. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The same hulls were tested in CFD based on the same conditions (speed, draft, water density and temperature, sea condition) as those in the semi-empirical, and the analytical methods, using a multi-fluid domain with a free surface. Following, from the CFD simulations results, the hull with the best performance was chosen, and a full resistance curve was obtained, and compared with the semi-empirical results, and found that both tests giving similar outcome, which validates that the CFD simulations. Furthermore, the models were simulated in CFD in a mono-fluid domain in order to be able to compute the wave resistance to find the actual outcome of the resistance. These results were compared with the thin ship theory results and resistance curve found to have approximately similar behaviour. Finally,  a script which computes the wave resistance based in Michell’s used to evaluate the CFD wave resistance results. Both methods gave similar results up to a particular, where beyond that speed, Michell’s theory gave higher outcomes, which is because it overestimates the resistance at higher Froude numbers.
